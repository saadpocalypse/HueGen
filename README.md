# HueGen

HueGen is a handy tool designed to help you select the perfect color palette for your web application. It's not uncommon to think you've chosen the right colors, only to find out they don't look quite as good in practice. HueGen is a minimalist web-based application that lets you preview your color palette in real time, allowing you to visualize how it will appear in your app. It is fully responsive, has dummy links, buttons, graphics and icons. With HueGen, you can experiment with different color schemes and make sure they work before you commit to them. 

You can try it out [here](https://color-palette-generator-woad.vercel.app).
